An overdose of medications occurs with the introduction of large doses of an active substance or poison into the body. 
Overdose is divided into 3 stages. 
In the first stage, you experience nausea and hallucinations—é. 
In the second stage, you wash out to lose consciousness. 
In the third stage, your health will begin to decline. 
Overdose is excreted from the body over time.
