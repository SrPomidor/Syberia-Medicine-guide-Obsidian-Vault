## SEPSIS ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7808279/176216035-ac3b8611-f02b-4761-a1bf-3d78e665f759.png)

Sepsis occurs when an infection enters an open wound. 
This can happen from a zombie scratch, knife, or bullet wound with a small chance. 
And also with a great chance when manipulating dirty hands with an open wound. 
If you do not treat the sepsis, over time, your health will start to go away.
Sepsis is treated with strong antibiotics (lvl 3)
