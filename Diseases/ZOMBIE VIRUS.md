#ZombieVirus #problem
The zombie virus is transmitted by airborne droplets and through body fluids. 
You can get sick with a small chance when fighting zombies in melee. 
The chance of infection increases if a zombie inflicted wounds on you. 
Use a face mask and anti-puff and ballistic armours to reduce the chance of infection.
The virus has a very long incubation period. The player has more than a real hour of time to find the antidote.
At the terminal stage of infection, your health begins to decline rapidly.
