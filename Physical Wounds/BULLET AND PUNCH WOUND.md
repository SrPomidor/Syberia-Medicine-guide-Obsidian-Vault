A player can obtain a bullet wound from firearms. 
It is characterized by severe bleeding and requires immediate dressing. 
Bandaging with a hemostatic bandage will be more effective than a regular bandage or rag. 
After dressing, the wound will continue to bleed slightly until the bullet is removed with a surgical kit.
Body armour in good condition can protect you from bullet wounds. But the chance of penetrating the armour is calculated using the ballistic calculator. 
Thus, light body armour will protect you from small calibres but will not protect you from medium and large calibres. If a bulletproof vest blocks a bullet, you get an outarmour injury in the form of a hematoma.
