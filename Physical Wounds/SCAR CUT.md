## SCAR / CUT ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7808279/176216459-4f94fe88-a0a0-42af-a537-0623cbcaf2c8.png)
#problem
Minor cuts or scrapes when fighting zombies or sharp weapons with a small chance. 
With this wound, blood practically does not flow out, so sometimes it is better not to interact with the wound once again if you have dirty hands.
It can be tied with rags or bandages.
